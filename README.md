Overview
The Web3 Mining Airdrop DApp provides a user-friendly interface to participate in Ethereum-based mining airdrops. This project ensures transparency and trust in the airdrop process through the use of smart contracts. Users can mine tokens, monitor their mining activity, and receive airdrops seamlessly.

Features
Mining Participation: Engage in mining activities to earn tokens.
Airdrop Rewards: Receive tokens as airdrops based on mining contributions.
Real-time Updates: Get instant notifications for mining rewards and airdrop events.
Ethereum Wallet Integration: Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to participate directly.
Transparent Process: All mining and airdrop activities are recorded on the blockchain.
Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project locally and start participating in web3 mining airdrops.

Prerequisites
Node.js: Ensure Node.js is installed. Download it from nodejs.org.
Installation
Clone the repository:
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Rise-In/XXX-Bootcamp-FinalCase.git
Navigate to the project directory:
sh
Copy code
cd XXX-Bootcamp-FinalCase
Install required npm packages:
sh
Copy code
npm install
Usage
Start the development server:
sh
Copy code
npm start
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the DApp.
Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the DApp.
Participate in mining activities, monitor your progress, and receive airdrops.
Smart Contracts
The smart contracts in this project facilitate the mining and airdrop process. They handle mining contributions, airdrop distributions, and participant records. These contracts are deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

MiningAirdropFactory.sol: Responsible for creating new mining airdrop events.
MiningAirdrop.sol: Manages mining activities, token distribution, and airdrop rewards for individual events.
Testing
Smart contract tests are located in the test folder. These tests ensure the correct functioning of the smart contract. To run the tests, follow these steps:

Open a terminal in the project directory.
Run the following command to execute the tests:
sh
Copy code
truffle test
This command will initiate the smart contract tests and display the results in the terminal.

Frontend
The DApp frontend is built using modern web technologies including React.js. It provides an intuitive and interactive user interface for mining and airdrop participation.

React.js: Powers the DApp's user interface.
Web3.js: The Ethereum JavaScript API for smart contract interaction.
MetaMask: A popular Ethereum wallet browser extension for secure transactions.
